LinearEquation Class

Instance Variables:
    private int x - This variable represents the x coordinate.
    private int y - This variable represents the y coordinate.

Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x, int y)

Methods:
    public double slope() - This method will display the slope of the two points.
    public double y-int() - This method will display the y intercept of the line.
    public double distance() - This method will display the distance between the two points.
    public String toString() - This method will display all information about this instance, including x and y coordinates, slope intercept form equation, etc.
