LinearEquation Class

Import:
import static java.lang.Math.pow; - This will allow me to take the square of a number.
import static java.lang.Math.sqrt; - This will allow me to take the root of a number.
import java.text.DecimalFormat; - This will allow me to round my numbers.

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - This variable represents the x coordinate.
    private int y1 - This variable represents the y coordinate.
    private int x2 - This variable represents the x coordinate.
    private int y2 - This variable represents the y coordinate.
    private double x - This variable represents the x coordinate
    private static final DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("0.00");

Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

Methods:
    public int rise() - This method will return y2-y1.
    public int run() - This method will return x2-x1.
    public double slope() - This method will calculate the slope. (rise/run)
    public double y-int() - This method will return the y intercept of the line.
    public double distance() - This method will display the distance between the two points, using the equation sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
    public String toString() - This method will display all information about this instance, including x and y coordinates, slope intercept form equation, etc.
    public String equation() - This method will return the linear equation of the two points.
    public int xToInteger() - This method will use the substring method to get the x value and parse it into an integer. (substring.(1, indexOf(,)) // Something along those lines.
    public int yToInteger() - This method will use the substring method to get the y value and parse it into an integer.

Step 1: Import scanner.
Step 2: Ask user to enter first coordinate point.
Step 3: Parse the coordinate points into their own variables x1 and y1.
Step 4: Ask user to enter second coordinate point.
Step 5: Parse the coordinate points into their own variables x2 and y2.
Step 6: Use slope() method to calculate the slope.
Step 7: Use y-int() method to calculate the y-int.
Step 8: Use distance() method to calculate the distance.
Step 9: Use the equation() method to create a linear equation.
Step 10: Use the toString method to display all of the information.
