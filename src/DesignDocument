LinearEquation Class

Import:
import static java.lang.Math.*; - This will allow me to use the math class.
import java.util.Scanner; - This will allow me to use the scanner class.

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - This variable represents the x coordinate.
    private int y1 - This variable represents the y coordinate.
    private int x2 - This variable represents the x coordinate.
    private int y2 - This variable represents the y coordinate.
    private double x - This variable represents the x coordinate

Constructors:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

Methods:
    public int rise() - This method will return y2-y1.
    public int run() - This method will return x2-x1.
    public double slope() - This method will calculate the slope. (rise/run)
    public double intercept() - This method will return the y intercept of the line.
    public double distance() - This method will display the distance between the two points, using the equation sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
    public String toString() - This method will display and calculate all information about this instance, including x and y coordinates, slope intercept form equation, etc.
    public String equation() - This method will return the linear equation of the two points.
    public double solveEquation(x) - This method will return the y coordinate of the linear equation when a specific x value is inputted.

Step 1: Import scanner.
Step 2: Ask user to enter first coordinate point.
Step 3: Parse the coordinate points into their own variables x1 and y1.
Step 4: Ask user to enter second coordinate point.
Step 5: Parse the coordinate points into their own variables x2 and y2.
Step 6: Create a new LinearEquation object.
Step 7: Display all information using toString method.
Step 8: Ask user for new x value and use scanner to input as a double.
Step 9: Display the solved coordinate point.
